# Hello friend 👋

I am a postgraduate researcher at the University of Exeter. My research focuses on the impacts of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), a method of solar climate intervention. My Ph.D. focused on stratospheric aerosols and their impacts, from assessing the UK Earth System Model at replicating a recent volcanic eruption, to evaluating the impacts of multiple SAI strategies. Currently, I am investigating the impact of a particular SAI strategy on extreme events and how it varies compared to a greenhouse gas warmed world. 

## 💭 My current projects
 
- 🌦 Risk-risk analyis of extreme events under a multilatitude SAI scenario
- 🔥 Model comparison of forest fire changes under SAI
